# Portofolio_Visualizer
This tool, examines and visualizes the major metrics of portfolios, such as volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios, in order to determine which portfolio is performing the best across all of the various areas. This tool is analyzing the historical daily returns of a number of different portfolios, some of which come from the algorithmic portfolios of a company, some of which represent the portfolios of well-known "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some of which come from large hedge funds and mutual funds. This analysis is used by the tool to compare its performance against other portfolios as well as the S&P 500 Index.

# Prepare the Data

To begin, we prepared several CSV files for analysis by reading them in and cleaning them. The CSV files have information regarding the returns of whale portfolios, the returns of algorithmic trading portfolios, and the historical prices of the S&P 500.

# Perform Quantitative Analysis

We perform an analysis on the data to see if any of the portfolios have a better performance than the stock market (more specifically, the S&P 500). Following the completion of an analysis as well as a risk assessment, we calculated rolling statistics and Sharpe ratios.

# Create a Custom Portfolio

We chose the stocks for our own portfolio, which consists of Adobe, Amazon, and Meta, during the same timeframe as the selection of stocks for the other portfolios so that we can compare the performance of our portfolio to that of the other portfolios.
